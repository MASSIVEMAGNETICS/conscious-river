## Usage

```python
from revolutionary_agi_system import RevolutionaryAGISystem

# Initialize the system
agi_system = RevolutionaryAGISystem()

# Start the system
agi_system.start()

# Process sensory inputs
sensory_inputs = {
    'visual': {'object': 'red_ball', 'distance': 5.0, 'importance': 0.7},
    'auditory': {'sound': 'bell_ringing', 'volume': 0.6, 'type': 'alert'},
    'emotional': {'state': 'curious', 'valence': 0.6, 'arousal': 0.5},
    'cognitive': {'thought': 'investigate sound source', 'certainty': 0.8}
}

result = agi_system.process(sensory_inputs)

# Get system status
status = agi_system.get_system_status()

# Stop the system
agi_system.stop()
```
